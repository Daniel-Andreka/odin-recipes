                <li>1 pund ground beef</li>
                <li>1/2 cup diced shiitake mushroom caps</li>
                <li>1 stalk green onion, diced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon oyster sauce</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1/8 teaspoon Chinese five-spice powder</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix milk and sugar for dough together in a bowl. Pour bun flour into another bowl and add gradually the milk mixture, stirring with a spatula.</li>
                <li>Form the dough into a ball and knead with your hands for about 20 minutes. Add olive oil and knead for 10 minutes more.</li>
                <li>Transfer dough to a dry bowl, cover with a towel, and let rest for 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine beef, mushrooms, green onions, cornstarch, sugar, soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame oil, salt, five-spice powder, and pepper in a bowl with your hands until thoroughly mixed. Form the filling into 12 equally sized meatballs.</li>
                <li>Roll dough on a lightly floured surface and cut into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece out with a rolling pin to a circle, no more than 5 inches in diameter.</li>
                <li>Cover each meatball with a dough circle, pinching the edges to close.</li>
                <li>Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add beef buns, working in batches as needed, cover, and steam until meat is no longer pink, about 45 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
