# Hello There!

My name is Daniel. 

**In this project** I tried to do a simple webpage 
that has some delicious recipes on it.

At first I only created the `index.html` file
which have links to the recipes.
All of the recipes are in the *recipes* folder,
`broccoli-soup.html`, `miso-soup.html` and `nikuman.html`

After finishing with the html files, I added style
to the pages. I don't think I have a good taste for 
design, but I like the end result.

**During this project** I used *html*, *css* and *git* .

I wish luck to everyone who's doing the odin project.
